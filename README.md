# RAM Monorepo

RAM monorepo implements components of Topology protocol stack.

## Running `ramd`

To build `ramd`, Rust (version 1.77.2 or later) is required. Please make sure Rust is installed and then run:

```
make run-ramd
```

It will run `ramd` and generate default config and necessary files. To view these files, use:

```
cd $HOME/.ramd
ls
```

(Optional) If you wish to change the location of these files, you can set `RAMD_DIR_NAME` environment variable in .env file as demonstrated [here](./.env.example). After configuring .env and running `ramd`, you can access the files with:

```
cd $HOME/{RAMD_DIR_NAME}
ls
```

If you encounter any issues, please feel free to [reach out](#contact) to us.
