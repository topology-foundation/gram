# Contributing to RAM Monorepo

Thank you for considering improvements to RAM monorepo! We are always happy to receive contributions across a broad spectrum, such as:

- Reporting new issues.
- Enhancing documentation.
- Fixing bugs.
- Implementing new features.

To contribute, please open a PR with your changes for review. For more complex changes, we recommend identifying an existing issue or creating a new one and sync with the maintainers to prevent any wasted efforts or duplication.

## Finding an Issue

You may find an existing issue that interests you. To facilitate our journey, please communicate with the maintainers before starting work on it.

If you have an idea and cannot find a related issue, feel free to open one. Before doing so, please consider:

- Does a similar issue already exist?
- Is the issue being proposed clearly explained?
- Is the issue important and sufficiently prepared to ask the community to spend time reviewing?

Please avoid opening issues to ask questions. Instead, use our [Discord](https://discord.gg/hMsQas3Vw9) for inquiries.

## Opening a Pull Request

All changes must be submitted as a PR and approved by the maintainers. For your PR, please ensure that:

- The branch name should follow [git flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
- The PR should have a descriptive title and detailed content.
- The PR should pass all tests and linters.

In our effort to maintain healthy code, we kindly ask you to review:

- Correctness: Is the change well-designed and does it function correctly and efficiently?
- Comprehension: Can others easily understand the change? Remember, code is read many more times than it is written. It's often helpful to use the maxim “the customer is always right.”
- Consistency: Does the change adhere to agreed-on best practices for that particular programming language and remain consistent with the existing codebase?
- Attribution: If the change borrows code from other open sources, it must comply with their licensing and attribute credit appropriately.

## The Review Process

All PRs must go through the review process that involves:

- The maintainers, including other collaborators, may leave comments, ask questions and offer suggestions. Further changes can be made by pushing additional commits to the same branch.
- We aim to foster a culture of trust and respect. Please be polite and professional.
- During the process, other PRs that conflict with yours may be merged. Please resolve these conflicts by applying those changes to your branch.
- When the PR is ready for review again, leaving a comment mentioning the reviewers would help resume the process.
- The reviewers can indicate a PR is ready for merging by approving it. Approved PRs will then be merged by the maintainers.
- Please be responsive to discussions and modifications to help the review process proceed in a timely fashion.
